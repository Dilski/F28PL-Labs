Q1 - Write a function of type bool -> bool -> bool.
A1 - fun IAnd (x:bool) (y:bool) = x=y;

Q2 - How many different (in the sense of calculating different truth-tables) functions are there in bool -> bool -> bool?
A2 - 16. There are 2 inputs and each of those inputs can be one of two things. Therefore there are 2^2 combinations of inputs. The output of the function can be one of two, so the possible outputs would be 2^combinations of inputs. Therefore we have 2^2^2 which is 16

Q3 - Explain the similarities and differences between fn (x:int) => x and fn (x:real) => x.
A3 - Both functions are an identity function, which maps a number to itself (or multiplies by 1)

Q4 - Write two functions of type ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> bool.
     a) return true when the first argument is true of all elements in the second argument.
     b) should return true when the first argument is true of some element in the second argument.
A4 - a) fun allTrue f [] = true
          | allTrue f (hd::tl) = if (f hd) then (allTrue f tl) else false;
     b) fun someTrue f [] = false
          | someTrue f (hd::tl) = if (f hd) then true else (someTrue f tl);

Q5 - Write a function of type 'a -> unit. Is it the only one?
A5 - fun nope n = ();
     This is the only one.

Q6 - Write a function of type 'a -> ('a*'a). Is it the only one?
A6 - fun tupple x = (x,x);
     This is the only one.

Q7 - Write a function of type 'a -> 'b -> ('a*'b)
A7 - fun tuppleTwo a b = (a,b);

Q8 - How many different functions are there in 'a -> 'b -> ('a*'b)
A8 - There is only one.

Q9 - Write a function of type 'a -> 'a -> ('a*'a)
A9 - fun Q9 (x:'a) (y:'a) = (x,y);

A10 - How many different functions are there in 'a -> 'a -> ('a*'a)?
Q10 - There is only one 

Q11 - Write a function of type (('a -> 'b)*'a) -> 'b.
A11 - fun Q11 (f, n) = f n;

Q12 - How many different functions are there in (('a -> 'b)*'a) -> 'b?
A12 - There is only one.

Q13 - Write a function of type ('a -> 'b) -> ('b -> 'c) -> ('a -> 'c).
A13 - fun Q13 funa funb = funb o funa;

Q14 - How many different functions are there in ('a -> 'b) -> ('b -> 'c) -> ('a -> 'c)?
A14 - There is only 1

Q15 - Write a function of type ('a -> ('b -> 'c)) -> ('a -> 'b) -> ('a -> 'c).
A15 -
